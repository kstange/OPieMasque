***Note:** OPie is not currently updated for 11.0.0 and seems to be broken for
many actions. Skinning still works fine, so I'm bumping the version to mark
OPie Masque as compatible only with the new game version. If the OPie update
requires any fixes in OPie Masque, I'll get a release out within a day or so
of the OPie update.*
