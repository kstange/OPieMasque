# About Opie Masque

You can install this addon from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/opie-masque "CurseForge"), [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/opiemasque), or [WoW Interface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info22226-OPieMasque.html).

This addon enables [Masque](https://github.com/SFX-WoW/Masque) ([CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/masque), [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/masque), [WoWInterface](https://wowinterface.com/downloads/info12097-Masque.html)) to skin [OPie](https://www.townlong-yak.com/addons/opie) ([CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/opie), [WoW Interface](https://wowinterface.com/downloads/info9094-OPie.html)) rings.  It requires Masque and OPie to function and is exposed in the settings for both Opie (enabling Masque support) and Masque (setting skin configuration).

I have not tested this with Classic or Wrath Classic, but if there's enough interest I may accept patches.
