# About Opie Masque

You can install this addon from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/opie-masque-revived "CurseForge"), [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/opiemasque), or [WoWInterface](https://wowinterface.com/downloads/info26505-OPieMasque.html).

This addon enables [Masque](https://github.com/SFX-WoW/Masque) ([CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/masque), [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/masque), [WoWInterface](https://wowinterface.com/downloads/info12097-Masque.html)) to skin [OPie](https://www.townlong-yak.com/addons/opie) ([CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/opie), [WoWInterface](https://wowinterface.com/downloads/info9094-OPie.html)) rings.  It requires Masque and OPie to function and is exposed in the settings for both Opie (enabling Masque support) and Masque (setting skin configuration).

I've done very limited testing with Classic Era and Wrath Classic because I don't play them, but users have reported that Opie Masque works as-is.  If you report bugs or submit patches, I'll do my best to fix them.
